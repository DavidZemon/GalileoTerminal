Galileo Arduino Terminal Application
====================================

Running this application with the full-fat Linux operating system on the
Galileo will give you an interactive shell-like environment without
having to buy a silly 3.5mm serial cable. You will not be able to interact with
a command once it is running - for instance, you can't (successfully) run vi. It
is great, however, for setting up WiFi or running some basic commands if you
don't want to buy a useless cable.

Make sure to change two settings in the Arduino serial monitor:

    1. Baud rate set to 115,200
    2. Line ending set to NEWLINE
